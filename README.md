# LEARNING CATS

The object of this repository is to store material I used to learn Scala Cats.

For learning, I will be using, mainly:

- [This Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/functional-programming-with-scala-cats/);
- [Cats official documentation](https://typelevel.org/cats/); 
- Internet tutorials.

Every material will be stored in a static page for reading, recapitulation, etc.
