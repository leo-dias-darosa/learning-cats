<h1>
    Write to file functionality
</h1>
<p>
    Let's start with a problem. Suppose we want a trait with a write operation that takes an object and write it to a file
    somewhere.
</p>
<p>
    The object can be of any type:
</p>

<pre>
Int, String, Person(age: Int, name: String)
</pre>

<p> How should we define this trait? </p>

<h2>
    1. WriteStuff trait with type Any
</h2>
<p> One easy way of doing that is to define the trait with a write method that takes a parameter of type Any: </p>

<pre>
trait WriteStuff {
    def write(obj: Any): Unit
}
</pre>

<h3> a. Implementing this trait</h3>
<p>
    Let's write an implementation for this trait. We define an object WriteFile that extends WriteStuff.
</p>

<pre>
object WriteFile extends WriteStuff {
    override def write(obj: Any): Unit = ???
}
</pre>

<p>
    The implementation is composed of two parts:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The first is a handler that take the obj and process it according to its type, transforming the obj in an
        Array[Byte];
    </li>
    <li>The second takes the Array[Byte] and write/flush to the output.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    So we get the following code:
</p>
<pre>
object WriteFile extends WriteStuff {
    override def write(obj: Any): Unit = {
        val bytes: Array[Byte] = ???

        Using(new FileOutputStream("testingWriteStuffWithAny")) { os =>
            os.write(bytes)
            os.flush()
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Now we have to provide an implementation for the val bytes. This is actually the part that matters. Since we have
    a variable of type Any, we need to know what we are dealing with. We can use pattern matching for that.
</p>

<p>
    Consider the following code, that handles Int, String, and throw an exception if obj is of other type:
</p>
<pre>
object WriteFile extends WriteStuff {
  override def write(obj: Any): Unit = {
    val bytes: Array[Byte] = obj match {
      case i: Int =>
        val byteBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(4)
        byteBuffer.putInt(i)
        byteBuffer.array()

      case s: String => s.getBytes

      case _ => throw new Exception("unhandled")
    }

    Using(new FileOutputStream("learning-cats/testingWriteFileWithAnyType")) { os =>
      os.write(bytes)
      os.flush()
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    To test it, we can simply call WriteFile.write() with an String:
</p>

<pre>
    WriteFile.write("Hello Any obj")
</pre>

<h3>
    b. What are the pros and cons of writing the WriteStuff trait with the Any obj approach?
</h3>
<p> The pros: </p>
<ol>
    <li>It is very simple.</li>
</ol>

<p> The (main) cons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>If the type is not handled, an exception is thrown during execution;</li>
    <li>The method has two responsibilities:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>It converts the object to Array[Byte];</li>
        <li>It writes the obj.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<p> How to improve?</p>

<h2> 2. WriteStuff trait with inheritance</h2>
<p>
    It is possible to write a second solution with inheritance. This way, we delegate the responsibility of transforming
    the obj to Array[Byte] to another method.
</p>
<p> This is possible by creating a trait specifically to encoding obj, and another to write obj. </p>
<pre>
trait WriteStuff {
  def write(obj: EncodableObj): Unit
}

trait EncodableObj {
  def encode(): Array[Byte]
}
</pre>

<h3> a. Extending EncodableObj</h3>
<p> Let's define a custom class that extends EncodableObj. We are not really worried about the functionality.
    Just take two strings and combine them in an Array[Byte].
</p>
<pre>
case class fullName(firstName: String, lastName: String) extends EncodableObj {
    override def encode(): Array[Byte] = firstName.getBytes ++ " ".getBytes ++ lastName.getBytes
}
</pre>

<h3>b. WriteFile object extending WriteStuff</h3>
<p> Now let's create the same WriteFile object that extends WriteStuff, and implements the write method.</p>
<pre>
object WriteFile extends WriteStuff {
  override def write(obj: EncodableObj): Unit = {
    val bytes: Array[Byte] = obj.encode()

    Using(
      new FileOutputStream("learning-cats/testingWriteFileInheritance")) {
      os =>
      os.write(bytes)
      os.flush()
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p> See how it is not necessary to implement the transformation from obj to Array[Byte] in the WriteFile object. We
    can just call the encode() method from the obj, and we get the type that we want.
</p>

<p> We can test this implementation by calling:</p>
<pre>
WriteFile.write(fullName("leo", "dias"))
</pre>

<h3> c. What are the pros and cons of writing the WriteStuff trait with the inheritance approach? </h3>
<p> The pros:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Each method has a unique responsibility;</li>
    <li>It is easy to test;</li>
    <li>If there is an unhandled type, we get a compile error, not an execution error.</li>
</ol>
<p> The cons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>How to extend EncodableObj in classes we don't have control over, such as Int? It is not trivial;</li>
    <li>For the classes that can extend EncodableObj, it is possible to provide only one implementation for the encode
        method;
    </li>
    <li>It is necessary to put an extra method in the class that we are extending: We need to add the encode method to
        the class fullName. In big projects, with a lot of traits or big classes, there are a lot of methods already, you are
        including more complexity, it might be necessary to overload methods. Things get complicated.
    </li>
</ol>

<p> Yet again, how to improve?</p>

<h2>3. WriteStuff trait with Typeclass</h2>

<p>The most elegant solution to this trait is writing it with typeclasses. Let's take a look in the following
    code:
</p>
<pre>
trait ByteEncoder[A] {
  def encode(a: A): Array[Byte]
}

trait WriteStuff {
  def write[A](
              obj: A,
              enc: ByteEncoder[A]
              ): Unit
}
</pre>

<p> In this case, the ByteEncoder trait is parametrized ([A]), and the encode method receives an argument of type A. By
    defining that our argument obj also as type A in the write method of WriteStuff trait, and enc as a ByteEncoder also
    of type A, we can call directly enc.encode(obj) to get an Array[Byte].
</p>
<p> This mean that now we don't extend classes with ByteEncoder, but we write instances for implementation. </p>
<h3> a. Implementation of WriteFile trait with typeclasses </h3>
<p> To make it clearer, let's take a look at the WriteFile object below:</p>
<pre>
object WriteObject extends WriteStuff {
  override def write[A](obj: A, enc: ByteEncoder[A]): Unit = {
    val bytes: Array[Byte] = enc.encode(obj)

    Using(
      new FileOutputStream("C:/Users/Leonardo/Desktop/Learning/learning-cats/testingWriteFileTypeclass")) {
      os =>
        os.write(bytes)
        os.flush()
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
    This works fine. However, we can't just run our code as of right now and try to write obj to a file, as the
    WriteObject is very generic and does not have any implementation yet.
</p>

<h3> b. Implementing an Int object </h3>
<p> Remember that in the inheritance example one of the major drawbacks was not being able to implement a WriteFile
    for an Int? Let's start by implementing the WriteFile with typeclasses for Ints.
</p>
<p> We instantiate an object extending ByteEncoder with Int: </p>
<pre>
object IntByteEncoder extends ByteEncoder[Int] {
  override def encode(n: Int): Array[Byte] = {
    val byteBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(4)
    byteBuffer.putInt(n)
    byteBuffer.array()
  }
}
</pre>

<p>We now can call the write method in WriteObject by passing our obj (20), and the encoder for its type:</p>
<pre>
WriteObject.write[Int](20, IntByteEncoder)
</pre>
<p> This works perfectly! </p>

<h3> c. Writing other types </h3>
<p> If we need to write any other type with WriteObject, we can do something similar. For String types, for example:</p>
<pre>
object StringByteEncoder extends ByteEncoder[String] {
  override def encode(s: String): Array[Byte] = s.getBytes
}

WriteObject.write("leo dias", StringByteEncoder)
</pre>

<h3> d. Advantages of typeclass solution </h3>
<p> By writing the trait this way we have several advantages:</p>
<ol>
    <li> ByteEncoder can be instanced by any type;</li>
    <li> It is very clean;</li>
    <li> We can write pretty much any object.</li>
    <li> It is possible to have several implementations for the same type (think about handling Ints differently based
        on something).</li>
</ol>
<p> Bonus advantage: It is pretty neat :D </p>
