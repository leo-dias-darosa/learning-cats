    Write to file functionality using Any type
</h1>
<p>
    Let's start with a problem. Suppose we want a trait with a write operation that takes an object and write it to a file
    somewhere.
</p>
<p>
    The object can be of any type:
</p>

<pre>
    Int, String, Person(age: Int, name: String)
</pre>

<p> How should we define this trait? </p>

<p> One easy way of doing that is to define the trait with a write method that takes a parameter of type Any </p>

<pre>
    trait WriteStuff {
        def write(obj: Any): Unit
    }
</pre>

<p>
    However, this is not the most elegant solution.
